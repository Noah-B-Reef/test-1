  <title>Introduction to Differential Equaitons</title>

  <p><em>Differential Equations</em> describe motion of planets, population dynamics, fluid flow, 
     and much more in the phyiscal world. Since modelling the aforementioned is important for scientists, it would suffice
     to say that differential equations will appear often throughout your study of Physics, Engineering, and Mathematics.</p>

  <p>Differential Equations are equations that contain a function <m>y</m>, its independent variables, and its derivatives.
     The study of differential equations is concerned with the problem of determining a realtionship among the variables from the
     information given to us about themselves and their derivatives. For example, the equation
     <m> \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 3\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 0 </m>
      is a differential equation. The function <m>y(x)</m> is the unknown function that we are trying to solve for.</p>
