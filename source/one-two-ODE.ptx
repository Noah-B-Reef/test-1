  <title>Ordinary Differential Equations</title>

  <p>
    We will start this section by introducting one type of differential equation aptly called an 
     <em>Ordinary Differential Equation</em>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-ODE">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x)</m> define a function of <m>x</m> on an interval <m>I: a &lt; x &lt; b </m>. 
        By an <em>Ordinary Differential Equation</em> we mean an equation involving <m>x</m>, the function
        <m>f(x)</m> and one or more of its derivatives.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Note that by <xref ref="def-ODE"/> when we talk about an ordinary differential equation we are talking about an equation
    whose function that only consists of a single independent-variable, such that is derivatives are "ordinary".

  <example>
    <title>Example of ODE's</title>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of ordinary differential equations:
      <mdn>
      <mrow>
        \frac{dy}{dx} + y \amp = 0
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx} + y \amp = 0
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \frac{d^3y}{dx^3} + 3\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 3\frac{dy}{dx} + y \amp= 0
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \amp = \frac{1}{1-x^2} 
      </mrow>
